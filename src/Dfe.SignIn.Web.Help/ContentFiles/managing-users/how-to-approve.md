As an approver, you have the responsibility of approving and rejecting requests.

There are three different types of requests you may receive:

- organisation requests
- service access requests
- sub-service access requests

When reviewing a request, you should check that:

- the user is who they claim to be
- the user has a valid reason for their request
- there are no security concerns around giving the user access

Follow the instructions below to approve an organisation, service or sub-service access request.

## Approving an organisation request
