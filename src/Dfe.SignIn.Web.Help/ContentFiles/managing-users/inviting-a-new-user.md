You can add someone to your list of users by following the steps below:

1. Choose 'invite new user' from the related actions list.

2. Fill in their details and add services to their account (if required).

3. The user will get an email asking them to complete their account set-up.

When you invite a new user, you must:

- Use a real work email address that shows the person’s name.
- Not use a shared or general email address.

Examples of not allowed email addresses:

- admin@gmail.com
- head@yahoo.com

These are not allowed because:

- admin and head are not a real persons name.
- @gmail.com and @yahoo.com are generic email providers, not work email addresses.
