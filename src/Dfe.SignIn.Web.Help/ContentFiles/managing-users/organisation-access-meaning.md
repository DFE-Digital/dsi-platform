  Find out what happens when you grant a user access to an organisation.

If you grant organisation access to an end user, it simply adds them to the list of users registered under the organisation.

The user will not get access to any services or sensitive information unless you [add this manually](/managing-users/view-user). However, the user will automatically get access to any ID-only services for that organisation.

## Responding to an organisation access request

As an approver you can either reject or approve a user’s request to access your organisation. All requests can be viewed in the requests area, where you can respond accordingly.
See our step-by-step guides for responding to a request:

[How to approve requests](/managing-users/how-to-approve)

[How to reject requests](/managing-users/how-to-reject)
