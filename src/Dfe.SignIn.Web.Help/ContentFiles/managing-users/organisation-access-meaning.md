If you grant organisation access to an end user, it simply adds them to the list of users registered under the organisation.

The user will not have access to any services or sensitive data unless [added manually](/managing-users/view-user).

## Responding to an organisation access request

As an approver you can either reject or approve a userâ€™s request to access your organisation. All requests can be viewed in the requests area, where you can respond accordingly.
See our step-by-step guides for responding to a request:

[How to approve a request](/managing-users/how-to-approve)

[How to reject a request](/managing-users/how-to-reject)
