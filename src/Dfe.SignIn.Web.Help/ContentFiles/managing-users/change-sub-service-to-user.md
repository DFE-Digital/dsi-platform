A sub-service is also known as a role or a form.

As an approver, you can change an end user’s sub-service access by adding or removing the sub-service from their account.

To add or remove sub-service access from an end user’s account:

1. Click on ‘manage users’.

2. Enter the name of the user in the search box whose access you want to change.

3. Click on their name.

4. Click ‘edit services’.

5. Select the service the sub-service belongs to and click ‘continue’.

6. Select or deselect the sub-services that you want to add or remove and click ‘continue’.

7. Review the sub-service changes for the end user and click ‘approve service’.

A notification banner will confirm you have changed sub-service access for the end user.

An end user can also request changes to their sub-service access, which an approver must either approve or reject.
