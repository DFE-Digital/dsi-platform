As an approver, you have the responsibility of approving and rejecting requests.

Rejecting requests that don't provide sufficient reasoning is essential in keeping your organisation secure.

There are three different types of requests you may receive:

- organisation requests
- service access requests
- sub-service access requests

Rejecting a service or sub-service access requests will not impact the user's organisation access. Any existing service or sub-service access associated with their account will also remain the same.

If there are multiple approvers at your organisation, you will not be able to respond to a request if another approver has already done so.

## Rejecting an organisation request

1. Click on 'requests' and select the request you would like to review

2. Carefully read the reason for request information provided.

3. Click 'reject'.

4. Provide a reason for why you have rejected the request.

The end user will receive an email informing them that their request has been rejected. This will include the reason for rejection details you provided.

The user will not be able to access your organisation.

## Rejecting a service access request

1. On the 'service requested' email, click the 'reject' button.
