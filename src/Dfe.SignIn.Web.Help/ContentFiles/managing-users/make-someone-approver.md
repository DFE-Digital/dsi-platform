There are two main ways to make someone an approver at your organisation. But in order to do either, you must first be an approver at that organisation yourself.

If you are an approver, here are your options.

## Give an existing user the approver status

If the person you are attempting to make an approver is already registered with your organisation as an end user:

1. Go to [manage users](${{ SERVICES_URL }}approvals/users).

2. Search for the user's name and select them from the search results.

3. Select 'make approver' from the actions list under the relevant organisation.

4. Select 'continue' on the confirmation screen to complete your task.

## Create a brand new approver

If the person you are attempting to make an approver is not yet registered with your organisation, you can invite them to join DfE Sign-in.

You can do this on the manage users page by following the ‘invite user’ option under related actions. Learn more about inviting a user.

## Can I revoke the approver status from a user?

If you want to revoke a user's approver status, so they can no longer manage users or add services to themselves, follow these steps:

1. Go to [manage users](${{ SERVICES_URL }}approvals/users).

2. Search for the user's name and select them from the search results.

3. Select 'remove approver access' from the actions list under the relevant organisation.

4. Select 'continue' on the confirmation screen to complete your task.
