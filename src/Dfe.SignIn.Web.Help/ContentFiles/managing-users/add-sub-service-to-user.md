As an approver, you can give end users access to a sub-service by adding it to their account. A sub-service is also known as a role or a form.

Here's how to add a sub-service to a user’s account:

1. In DfE Sign-in click on [manage users](${{ SERVICES_URL }}approvals/users) at the top of the page

2. Enter the name of the user whose permissions you want to change into the search box

3. Click on their name

4. Click the ‘Edit services’ link

5. Select the service you want to amend and then click continue

6. Select the sub-service and click continue

7. Review the amended service for the user and click ‘Approve service’

8. You will then see a banner confirming you have amended the the service
