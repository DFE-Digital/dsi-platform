title: The difference between an end-user and an approver

summary: |
  Approvers are tasked with several responsibilities relating to your organisation, including providing access to services.
---

An end user has the **standard** permission level and an approver has the **highest** permission level within DfE Sign-in.

## End users

The standard permission level allows end users to:

- request access to an organisation
- request access to a service or form
- manage their account details
- access services to complete tasks related to their job role

An end user cannot manage other users or add services to their own account without the permission of an approver.

## Approvers

The highest permission level allows approvers to:

- approve or reject requests to join their organisation
- invite new users to their organisation
- grant access to services and forms
- manage the permission levels of users at their organisation
- maintain security over who can and cannot access certain information around their organisation
- add services to both their own and user accounts

## Granting approver status to an end user

Changing an end user account to become an approver is something that can only be done by senior members of your organisation who also hold approver status.

One exception is if an organisation does not have an approver.

Please [contact us](/contact-us) if you believe this to be the case.
