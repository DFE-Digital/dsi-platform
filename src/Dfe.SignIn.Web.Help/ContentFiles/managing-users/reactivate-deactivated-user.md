summary: |
  Understand what you can do to reactivate an end user account after it’s been deactivated.
---

If you have an end user account that has been deactivated that needs reactivating, please raise a request using our [contact us form](/contact-us).

Accounts can only be reactivated by the support team and not by approvers.

For security reasons, all DfE Sign-In accounts are deactivated after 2 years of inactivity.

Accounts may also be deactivated if the email address doesn’t comply with the service [terms and conditions](/terms).
