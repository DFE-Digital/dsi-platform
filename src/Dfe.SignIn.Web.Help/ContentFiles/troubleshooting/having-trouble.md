If you experience an error message when trying to access a service you have access to, this is likely due to maintenance or fault. This is usually rectified within a couple of hours, so try again later.

Each individual service has a help team that you can contact should you encounter any problems. DfE Sign-in only hosts the services, therefore are unable to assist with specific service issues.

You can however use our [feedback form][DfE Sign-in user feedback] to let us know if you experience any technical issues when trying to use a service.
