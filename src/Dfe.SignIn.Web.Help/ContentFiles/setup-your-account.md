  Started making your DfE Sign-in account? You'll need access to an organisation. Here's what to do.
---

There are 3 steps involved in setting up your account.

## 1. Verifying your account

When you enter the email address you’d like your account to be associated with, you will be asked to enter a verification code.

This verification code will be sent to the email address you provided. Once entering, you’ll be able to create a secure password.

Multi-factor authentication has recently been introduced to DfE Sign-in, which will require you to enter a unique verification code sent to your email each time you sign in.
At present, receiving a code via email is the only authentication method available.

## 2. Connecting to an organisation

To use DfE Sign-in you will need to associate your account with an organisation.

You must have an established relationship with the organisation, such as being employed by them. If you are a multi-academy trust user, please use the main organisation to which you have an established relationship.

You will be asked to connect with only one organisation during initial account set-up, others may be added once account set-up is complete.

## 3. Getting access to services

During initial account set up, you’ll be able to request access to multiple services within the organisation you have requested access to.

These services are areas within DfE Sign-in that will allow you to complete tasks or see certain data, for example Publish to the Course Directory and Analyse School Performance.
