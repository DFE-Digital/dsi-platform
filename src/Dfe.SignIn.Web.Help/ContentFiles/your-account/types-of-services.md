  Learn about the 2 types of services that DfE Sign-In supports.
---

There are 2 different services accessible through your account:

1. ID-only services
2. Role-based services

## ID-only

These are services that you can access with your DfE Sign-In account, but no authorisation is required through DfE Sign-In.

You will be able to access certain ID-only services depending on the organisation(s) you’re associated with by navigating directly to the service’s home page.

DfE Sign-In doesn’t actively publish a list of these services as access is often granted only to those that need it.

Users should also ensure that the account is linked to the correct organisation they are accessing on behalf of.

## Role-based

These are services that you can access with your DfE Sign-In account with prior approval.

The levels of access of each service may vary depending on the organisation(s) you’re associated with.

You can see the list of services available as well as [request access](/your-account/request-service-access) to them by going to the request access to a service page.
