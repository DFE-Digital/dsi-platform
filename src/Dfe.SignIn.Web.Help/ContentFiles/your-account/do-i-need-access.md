  Understand what access you need to use DFE Sign-in as an approver and an end user.
---

No. You only need access to an organisation to use DfE Sign-in.

That means you can, if given approver status, manage users at your organisation without having services on your account.

However, if you are an end user, you won't be able to do much more than update your details.
