If you have approver status on DfE Sign-in, you can follow the steps below to add a service to your account.

If you are not an approver, you will need to [request access to a service](/your-account/request-service-access).

## Adding a service

1. Click on [services](${{ SERVICES_URL }}my-services) in the top banner.

2. Select 'add services to my account' from the related actions.

3. Choose the service you would like to add.

4. Select the forms or roles required, then press continue.

5. The selected service will now be visible on your services dashboard.

## Adding a service to more than one organisation

If you have multiple organisations associated with your account, you will be prompted to select the organisation you'd like to add the service to before proceeding.

A service can be added to multiple organisations, however, this cannot be done in one action. The steps above must be carried out for each individual organisation.
