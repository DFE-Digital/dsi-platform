  Find out how to request access to organisations.
---

You are able to have one or more organisations associated with your account. You must submit an individual request for each organisation you require access to by following the steps below:

1. Click on 'organisations' in the top banner.

2. Select 'request an organisation' from the related actions.

3. Search for the organisation by legal or trading name, URN, UPIN or UKPRN.

4. Select the organisation from the list.

5. In the box, provide a reason for why you require access to this organisation.

6. Select ‘confirm’.

## What happens next

An approver will see your reason for request and will reject or approve. You'll usually receive a response within 5 days. If there is no response within 5 days, contact our support team via the [contact-us](/contact-us) form.

In the meantime, you may want to chase up the request manually by contacting senior members of the organisation.
