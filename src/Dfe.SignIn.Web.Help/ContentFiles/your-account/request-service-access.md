DfE Sign-in allows access to various important services and sub-services in the education sector. Sub-services are sometimes referred to as a ‘role’ or ‘form’.

If you are an approver, you can still manage users at your organisation without any services associated with your account.

The only action end users can do without service access is update their personal details.

## Requesting access to a service or sub-service

Follow the steps below to request a service or sub-service:

1. Click on [services](${{ SERVICES_URL }}my-services) in the top banner.

2. Select 'Request access to a service'.

3. Choose the service(s) you would like to request access to.

4. If needed, select the sub-service(s) you would like to request access to.

5. Once you have reviewed the details, click 'Request service'.

Your request will be sent to an approver who will approve or reject your request. This will be someone from your organisation who has administration rights, not the Department for Education.

You can see how many approvers your organisation has under 'organisations' in the navigation.

## Changing your sub-service access

Follow the steps below to add or remove your sub-service access:

1. Click on 'view and edit services on my account'.

2. Select the service the sub-service belongs to and click ‘continue’.

3. Select or deselect the sub-services that you want to add or remove and click continue.

4. Once you have reviewed the details, click 'request sub-service changes'.

You will see a notification banner confirming your change request(s). The request will be sent to an approver to approve or reject.
If you deselect a sub-service that you currently have access to and this request is approved, you will lose access.
Checking the status of a request

If you do not receive an approval or rejection within 5 days of your request, you can email the approver. You will find their email address under the 'organisation' tab in the top banner.

Alternatively, you can contact our [support team](/contact-us).
