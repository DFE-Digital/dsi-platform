# What is select organisation?

A service can prompt the user to choose which organisation they would like to use the service as. This is particuarly useful for users that might be associated with multiple organisations.

Here are some common scenarios:

- A service wants to allow the user to authenticate without selecting an organisation.

- A service wants the user to select from any of the organisations that they are associated with immediately after the user has authenticated.

- A service wants the user to select from organisations which have been associated with the use for the service immediately after the user has authenticated.

- An authenticated user wants to change their selection having already made a selection.

A less common scenario:

- A service wants to prompt the user to select an organisation for a one-time interaction. For example, the organisation does not become the actively selected organisation.
